<HR>
<B>First and Second Rules of Opamps</B> 
<P>To be able to understand much of the following, the basic rules of opamps 
need to be firmly embedded in the skull of the reader. I came up with these many 
years ago, and - ignoring small errors caused by finite gain, input and output 
impedances - all opamp circuits make sense once these rules are understood. They 
are also discussed in the article <A href="http://sound.whsites.net/dwopa.htm" 
target="_blank">Designing With Opamps</A> in somewhat greater detail. Highly 
recommended if you are in the least bit unsure. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The two rules are as follows ... 
  <OL>
    <LI>An opamp will attempt to make both inputs exactly the same voltage (via 
    the feedback path)   
    <LI>If it cannot achieve #1, the output will assume the polarity of the most 
    positive input </LI></OL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These two rules describe <I>everything</I> an opamp does in <I>any</I> 
circuit, with no exceptions ... <I>provided that the opamp is operating within 
its normal parameters</I>. This means power supply voltage(s) must be within 
specifications, signal voltage is within the allowable range, and load impedance 
is equal to or greater than the minimum specified. The signal frequency must 
also be low enough to ensure that the opamp can perform normally for the chosen 
gain. For most cheap opamps, a gain of 100 with a frequency of 1kHz should be 
considered the maximum allowable, since the opamp's open loop gain may not be 
high enough to accommodate higher gain or frequency. 
<P>Armed with these rules and a basic understanding of Ohm's Law and analogue 
circuitry, it is possible to figure out what any opamp circuit will do under all 
normal operating conditions. Needless to say, the rules no longer apply if the 
opamp itself is faulty, or is operating outside its normal parameters (as 
discussed briefly above).</P>
<HR>
<B>Half Wave Precision Rectifier</B> 
<P>There are many applications for precision rectifiers, and while most are 
suitable for use in audio circuits, I thought it best to make this the first ESP 
Application Note. While some of the existing projects in the audio section have 
a rather tenuous link to audio, this information is more likely to be used for 
instrumentation purposes than pure audio applications. 
<P>Typically, the precision rectifier is not commonly used to drive analogue 
meter movements, as there are usually much simpler methods to drive floating 
loads such as meters. Precision rectifiers are more common where there is some 
degree of post processing needed, feeding the side chain of compressors and 
limiters, or to drive digital meters.</P>
<P>There are several different types of precision rectifier, but before we look 
any further, it is necessary to explain what a precision rectifier actually is. 
In its simplest form, a half wave precision rectifier is implemented using an 
opamp, and includes the diode in the feedback loop. This effectively cancels the 
forward voltage drop of the diode, so very low level signals (well below the 
diode's forward voltage) can still be rectified with minimal error.</P>
<P>The most basic form is shown in Figure 1, and while it does work, it has some 
serious limitations. The main one is speed - it will not work well with high 
frequency signals. To understand the reason, we need to examine the circuit 
closely. This knowledge applies to all subsequent circuits, and explains the 
reason for the apparent complexity.</P>
<P class="t-pic"><IMG alt="Figure 1" src="Precision%20Rectifiers_files/an001-f1.gif" 
border="1"><BR>Figure 1 - Basic Precision Half Wave Rectifier</P>
<P>For a low frequency positive input signal, 100% negative feedback is applied 
when the diode conducts. The forward voltage is effectively removed by the 
feedback, and the inverting input follows the positive half of the input signal 
almost perfectly. When the input signal becomes negative, the opamp has no 
feedback at all, so the output pin of the opamp swings negative as far as it 
can. Assuming 15V supplies, that means perhaps -14V on the opamp output.</P>
<P>When the input signal becomes positive again, the opamp's output voltage will 
take a finite time to swing back to zero, then to forward bias the diode and 
produce an output. This time is determined by the opamp's slew rate, and even a 
very fast opamp will be limited to low frequencies - especially for low input 
levels. The test voltage for the waveforms shown was 20mV at 1kHz. Although the 
circuit does work very well, it is limited to relatively low frequencies (less 
than 10kHz) and only becomes acceptably linear above 10mV or so (opamp 
dependent).</P>
<P>Note the oscillation at the rectified output. This is (more or less) real, 
and was confirmed with an actual (as opposed to simulated) circuit. This is the 
result of the opamp becoming open-loop with negative inputs. In most cases it is 
not actually a problem.</P>
<P class="t-pic"><IMG alt="Figure 2" src="Precision%20Rectifiers_files/an001-f2.gif" 
border="1"><BR>Figure 2 - Rectified Output and Opamp Output</P>
<P>Figure 2 shows the output waveform (left) and the waveform at the opamp 
output (right). The recovery time is obvious on the rectified signal, but the 
real source of the problem is quite apparent from the huge voltage swing before 
the diode. While this is of little consequence for high level signals, it causes 
considerable nonlinearity for low levels, such as the 20mV signal used in these 
examples.</P>
<P>The circuit is improved by reconfiguration, as shown in Figure 3. The 
additional diode prevents the opamp's output from swinging to the negative 
supply rail, and low level linearity is improved dramatically. A 2mV (peak) 
signal is rectified with reasonably good linearity. Although the opamp still 
operates open-loop at the point where the input swings from positive to negative 
or vice versa, the range is limited by the diode and resistor. Recovery is 
therefore a great deal faster.</P>
<P class="t-pic"><IMG alt="Figure 3" src="Precision%20Rectifiers_files/an001-f3.gif" 
border="1"><BR>Figure 3 - Improved Precision Half Wave Rectifier</P>
<P>This circuit also has its limitations. The input impedance is now determined 
by the input resistor, and of course it is more complicated than the basic 
version. It must be driven from a low impedance source. Not quite as apparent, 
the Figure 3 circuit also has a defined output load resistance (equal to R2), so 
if this circuit were to be used for charging a capacitor, the cap will discharge 
through R2. Although it would seem that the same problem exists with the simple 
version as well, R2 (in Figure 1) can actually be omitted, thus preventing 
capacitor discharge. Likewise, the input resistor (R1) shown in Figure 1 is also 
optional, and is needed only if there is no DC path to ground.</P>
<HR>
<B>Full Wave Precision Rectifiers</B> 
<P>Figure 4 shows the standard full wave version of the precision rectifier. 
This circuit is very common, and is pretty much the textbook version. It has 
been around for a very long time now, and I would include a reference to it if I 
knew where it originated. The tolerance of R1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are critical for 
good performance, and all five resistors should be 1% or better. Note that the 
diodes are connected to obtain a positive rectified signal. The second stage 
inverts the signal polarity. To obtain improved high frequency response, the 
resistor values should be reduced. 
<P class="t-pic"><IMG alt="Figure 4" src="Precision%20Rectifiers_files/an001-f4.gif" 
border="1"><BR>Figure 4 - Precision Full Wave Rectifier</P>
<P>This circuit is sensitive to source impedance, so it is important to ensure 
that it is driven from a low impedance, such as an opamp buffer stage. Input 
impedance as shown is 6.66k, and any additional series resistance at the input 
will cause errors in the output signal. The input impedance is linear. As shown, 
and using TL072 opamps, the circuit of Figure 4 has good linearity down to a 
couple of mV at low frequencies, but has a limited high frequency response. Use 
of high speed diodes, lower resistance values and faster opamps is recommended 
if you need greater sensitivity and/ or higher frequencies.</P>
<HR>
<B>The Alternative (Analog Devices)</B> 
<P>A little known variation of the full wave rectifier was published by Analog 
Devices, in Application Brief AB-109 [<A href="http://sound.whsites.net/appnotes/an001.htm#ref"> 
1 </A>]. In the original, a JFET was used as the rectifier for D2, although this 
is not necessary if a small amount of low level non-linearity is acceptable. The 
resistors marked with an asterisk (*) should be matched, although for normal use 
1% tolerance will be acceptable. C1 may be needed to prevent oscillation. 
<P class="t-pic"><IMG alt="Figure 5" src="Precision%20Rectifiers_files/an001-f5.gif" 
border="1"><BR>Figure 5 - Original Analog Devices Circuit</P>
<P>It was pointed out in the original application note that the forward voltage 
drop for D2 (the FET) must be less than that for D1, although no reason was 
given. As it turns out, this may make a difference for very low level signals, 
but appears to make little or no difference for sensible levels (above 20mV or 
so).</P>
<HR>
<B>Simplified Alternative</B><BR>
<P>For most applications, the circuit shown in Figure 6 will be more than 
acceptable. Linearity is very good at 20mV, but speed is still limited by the 
opamp. To obtain the best high frequency performance use a very fast opamp and 
reduce the resistor values. 
<P class="t-pic"><IMG alt="Figure 6" src="Precision%20Rectifiers_files/an001-f6.gif" 
border="1"><BR>Figure 6 - Simplified Version of the AD Circuit</P>
<P>It is virtually impossible to make a full wave precision rectifier any 
simpler, and the circuit shown will satisfy the majority of low frequency 
applications. Where very low levels are to be rectified, it is recommended that 
the signal be amplified first. While the use of Schottky (or germanium) diodes 
will improve low level and/or high frequency performance, it is unreasonable to 
expect perfect linearity from any rectifier circuit at extremely low levels. 
Operation up to 100kHz or more is possible by using fast opamps and diodes. R1 
is optional, and is only needed if the source is AC coupled, so extremely high 
input impedance (with no non-linearity) is possible. C1 may be needed to prevent 
oscillation. 
<P>The simplified version shown above (Figure 6) is also found in a Burr-Brown 
application note [<A href="http://sound.whsites.net/appnotes/an001.htm#ref"> 3 
</A>]. </P>
<HR>
<B>Another Version</B> 
<P>Purely by chance, I found the following variant in a phase meter circuit. 
This version is used in older SSL (Solid Stage Logic) mixers, as part of the 
phase correlation meter. This circuit exists on the Net in a few forum posts and 
what appears to be one unauthorised site where several SSL schematics are 
re-published. The original drawing I found is dated 1984. It's also referenced 
in a Burr-Brown paper from 1973 and an electronics engineering textbook [<A 
href="http://sound.whsites.net/appnotes/an001.htm#ref"> 5, 6 </A>].</P>
<P class="t-pic"><IMG alt="Figure 6A" src="Precision%20Rectifiers_files/an001-f6a.gif" 
border="1"><BR>Figure 6A - Another Version of the AD Circuit</P>
<P>While it initially looks completely different, that's simply because of the 
way it's drawn (I copied the drawing layout of the original). This version is 
interesting, in that the input is not only inverting, but provides the 
opportunity for the rectifier to have gain. The inverting input is of no 
consequence (it is a full wave rectifier after all), but it does mean that the 
input impedance is lower than normal ... although you could make all resistor 
values higher of course. Input impedance is equal to the value of R1, and is 
linear as long as the opamp is working well within its limits. 
<P>If R1 is made lower than R2 and R3, the circuit has gain. If R1 is 
<I>higher</I> than R2 and R3, the circuit can accept higher input voltages 
because it acts as an attenuator. For example, if R1 is 1k, the circuit has a 
gain of 10, and if 100k, the gain is 0.1 (an attenuation of 10). All normal 
opamp restrictions apply, so if a high gain is used frequency response will be 
affected. C1 is optional - you may need to include it if the circuit oscillates. 
The value will normally be between 10pF and 100pF, depending on the speed you 
need and circuit layout. 
<P>One interesting result of using the inverting topology is that the input node 
is a 'virtual earth' and it enables the circuit to sum multiple inputs. R1 can 
be duplicated to give another input, and this can be extended. The original SSL 
circuit used two of these rectifiers with four inputs each. Remember that this 
is the same as operating the first opamp with a gain of four, so high frequency 
response may be affected.</P>
<HR>
<B>Another Precision Rectifier (Intersil)</B> 
<P>A simple precision rectifier circuit was published by Intersil [<A href="http://sound.whsites.net/appnotes/an001.htm#ref"> 
2 </A>]. This is an interesting variation, because it uses a single supply opamp 
but still gives full-wave rectification, with both input and output earth 
(ground) referenced. Unfortunately, the specified opamp is not especially 
common, although other devices could be used. The CA3140 is a reasonably fast 
opamp, having a slew rate of 7V/us. I will leave it to the reader to determine 
suitable types (other than that suggested below). The essential features are 
that the two inputs must be able to operate at below zero volts (typically 
-0.5V), and the output must also include close to zero volts. 
<P class="t-pic"><IMG alt="Figure 7" src="Precision%20Rectifiers_files/an001-f7.gif" 
border="1"><BR>Figure 7 - Original Intersil Precision Rectifier Circuit</P>
<P>During the positive cycle of the input, the signal is directly fed through 
the feedback network to the output. R3 actually consists of R3 itself, plus the 
set value of VR2. The nominal value of the pair is 15k, and VR2 can be usually 
be dispensed with if precision resistors are used (R3 and VR2 are replaced by a 
single 15k resistor). 
<P>This gives a transfer function of ... 
<BLOCKQUOTE>	Gain = 1 / ( 1 + (( R1 + R2 ) / R3 )) ... 0.5 with the values 
  shown above </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>1V input will therefore give an output voltage of 0.5V. During this positive 
half-cycle of the input, the diode disconnects the op-amp output, which is at 
(or near) zero volts. Note that the application note shows a different gain 
equation which is incorrect. The equation shown above works. 
<P>During a negative half-cycle of the input signal, the CA3140 functions as a 
normal inverting amplifier with a gain equal to -( R2 / R1 ) ... 0.5 as shown. 
Since the inverting input is a virtual earth point, during a negative input it 
remains at or very near to zero volts. When the two gain equations are equal, 
the full wave output is symmetrical. Note that the output is not buffered, so 
the output should be connected only to high impedance stage, with an impedance 
much higher than R3.</P>
<P class="t-pic"><IMG alt="Figure 8" src="Precision%20Rectifiers_files/an001-f8.gif" 
border="1"><BR>Figure 8 - Modified Intersil Circuit Using Common Opamp</P>
<P>Where a simple, low output impedance precision rectifier is needed for low 
frequency signals (up to perhaps 10kHz as an upper limit), the simplified 
version above will do the job nicely. It does require an input voltage of at 
least 100mV, because there is no DC offset compensation. Because the LM358 is a 
dual opamp, the second half can be used as a buffer, providing a low output 
impedance. Minimum suggested input voltage is around 1V peak (710mV), which will 
give an average output voltage of 320mV. Higher input voltages will provide 
greater accuracy, but the maximum is a little under 10V RMS with a 15V DC supply 
as shown. The LM358 is not especially fast, but is readily available at low 
cost. 
<P><B>Limitations: &nbsp; </B>Note that the input impedance of this rectifier 
topology is non-linear. The impedance presented to the driving circuit is 30k 
for positive half cycles, but only 10k for negative half-cycles. This means that 
it must be driven from a low impedance source - typically another opamp. This 
increases the overall complexity of the final circuit.</P>
<HR>
<B>Single Supply Precision Rectifier (B-B/ TI)</B> 
<P>An interesting variation was shown in a Burr-Brown application note [<A href="http://sound.whsites.net/appnotes/an001.htm#ref"> 
3 </A>]. This rectifier operates from a single supply, but accepts a normal 
earth (ground) referenced AC input. The only restriction is that the incoming 
peak AC signal must be below the supply voltage (typically +5V for the OPA2337 
or OPA2340). The opamps used must be rail-to-rail, and the inputs must also 
accept a zero volt signal without causing the opamp to lose control. 
<P>The circuit is interesting for a number of reasons, not the least being that 
it uses a completely different approach from most of the others shown. The 
rectifier is not in the main feedback loop like all the others shown, but uses 
an ideal diode (created by U1B and D1) at the non-inverting input, and this is 
outside the feedback loop. 
<P class="t-pic"><IMG alt="Figure 9" src="Precision%20Rectifiers_files/an001-f9.gif" 
border="1"><BR>Figure 9 - Burr-Brown Circuit Using Suggested Opamp</P>
<P>For a positive-going input signal, the opamp (U1A) can only function as a 
unity gain buffer, since both inputs are driven positive. Both the non-inverting 
and inverting inputs have an identical signal, a condition that can only be 
achieved if the output is also identical. If the output signal attempted to 
differ, that would cause an offset at the inverting input which the opamp will 
correct. It is worth remembering my opamp rules described at the beginning of 
this app. note. 
<P>For a negative-going input signal, The ideal diode (D1 and U2B) prevents the 
non-inverting input from being pulled below zero volts. Should this happen, the 
opamp can no longer function normally, because input voltages are outside normal 
operating conditions. The opamp (U1A) now functions as a unity gain 
<I>inverting</I> buffer, with the inverting input maintained at zero volts by 
the feedback loop. If -10uA flows in R1, the opamp will ensure that +10uA flows 
through R2, thereby maintaining the inverting input at 0V as required. 
<P><B>Limitations: &nbsp; </B>Input impedance is non-linear, having an almost 
infinite impedance for positive half-cycles, and a 5k input impedance for 
negative half-cycles. The input must be driven from an earth (ground) referenced 
low impedance source. Capacitor coupled sources are especially problematical, 
because of the widely differing impedances for positive and negative going 
signals. The <I>maximum</I> source resistance for a capacitor-coupled signal 
input is 100 ohms for the circuit as shown (one hundredth of the resistor values 
used for the circuit), and preferably less. The capacitance is selected for the 
lowest frequency of interest.</P>
<HR>
<B>Simple Full Wave Rectifier</B> 
<P>This rectifier is something of an oddity, in that it is not really a 
precision rectifier, but it <I>is</I> full wave. It is an interesting circuit - 
sufficiently so that it warranted inclusion even if no-one ever uses it. This 
rectifier was used as part of an oscillator [<A href="http://sound.whsites.net/appnotes/an001.htm#ref"> 
4 </A>] and is interesting because of its apparent simplicity and wide bandwidth 
even with rather pedestrian opamps. 
<P>A simulation using TL072 opamps indicates that even with a tiny 5mV peak 
input signal (3.5mV RMS) the frequency response extends well past 10kHz but for 
low level signals serious amplitude non-linearity can be seen. The original 
article didn't even mention the rectifier, and no details were given at all. 
However, I have been able to determine the strengths and weaknesses by 
simulation. Additional weaknesses may show up in use of course.</P>
<P class="t-pic"><IMG alt="Figure 10" src="Precision%20Rectifiers_files/an001-f10.gif" 
border="1"><BR>Figure 10 - Simple Precision Full Wave Rectifier</P>
<P>One thing that is absolutely critical to the sensible operation of the 
circuit at low signal levels is that all diodes <I>must</I> be matched, and in 
excellent thermal contact with each other. The actual forward voltage of the 
diodes doesn't matter, but all must be identical. The lower signal level limit 
is determined by how well you match the diodes and how well they track each 
other with temperature changes. 
<P>The first stage allows the rectifier to have a high input impedance (R1 is 
10k as an example only). Nominal gain as shown is 2 (short R3 for unity gain), 
but actual gain is reduced slightly by an amount that changes with level. 1V 
peak input gives 1.96V peak output, and 100mV gives 172mV out. The difference in 
each case is small and diminishes with reducing input level, but it's enough to 
mean that the circuit can't really be called a precision rectifier.  
<P><B>Limitations: &nbsp; </B>Linearity is not very good. The circuit requires 
closely matched diodes for low level use because the diode voltage drops in the 
first stage (D1 &amp; D2) are used to offset the voltage drops of D3 &amp; D4. 
At input voltages of more than a volt or so, the non-linearities are unlikely to 
cause a problem, but diode matching is still essential (IMO). 
<P>Simple capacitor smoothing cannot be used at the output because the output is 
direct from an opamp, so a separate integrator is needed to get a smooth DC 
output. This applies to most of the other circuits shown here as well and isn't 
a serious limitation.</P>
<HR>
<B>Simple Full Wave Meter Amplifier</B> 
<P>The final circuit is a precision full-wave rectifier, but unlike the others 
shown it is specifically designed to drive a moving coil meter movement. There 
is no output voltage as such, but the circuit rectifies the incoming signal and 
converts it to a current to drive the meter. This general arrangement is (or 
was) extremely common, and could be found in audio millivoltmeters, distortion 
analysers, VU meters, and anywhere else where an AC voltage needed to be 
displayed on a moving coil meter. Digital meters have replaced it in most cases, 
but it's still useful, and there are some places where a moving coil meter is 
the best display for the purpose. This type of rectifier circuit is discussed in 
greater detail in <A href="http://sound.whsites.net/appnotes/an002.htm" target="_blank">AN002</A>. 
<P class="t-pic"><IMG alt="Figure 11" src="Precision%20Rectifiers_files/an001-f11.gif" 
border="1"><BR>Figure 11 - Moving Coil Meter Amplifier</P>
<P>The circuit is a voltage to current converter, and with R2 as 1k as shown, 
the current is 1mA/V. If a 1V RMS sinewave is applied to the input, the meter 
will read the <I>average</I>, which is 900µA. Adjusting R2 varies the 
sensitivity, and changing R2 to 900 ohms means the meter will show 1mA for each 
volt (RMS) at the input. This assumes a meter with a reasonably low resistance 
coil, although in theory the circuit will compensate for any series resistance. 
<P>This type of circuit almost always has R2 made up from a fixed value and a 
trimpot, so the meter can be calibrated. Although shown with an opamp IC, the 
amplifying circuit will often be discrete so that it can drive as much current 
as needed, as well as having a wide enough bandwidth for the purpose. 
Millivoltmeters and distortion analysers in particular often need an extended 
response (100kHz or more is common), and few opamp ICs are able to provide a 
wide enough bandwidth to work well with anything much over 15kHz. The problem is 
worse at low levels because the opamp output has to swing very quickly to 
overcome the diode forward voltage drop. It's common to use a capacitor in 
parallel with the movement to provide damping, but that also changes the 
calibration.</P>
<P><B>Limitations: &nbsp; </B>The output is very high impedance, so the meter 
movement is not damped unless a capacitor is used in parallel. The meter will 
then show the peak value which might not be desirable, depending on the 
application. 
<P>As already noted, the opamp needs to be very fast. Linearity is good provided 
the amplifier used has high bandwidth. The circuit works better with 
low-threshold diodes (Schottky or germanium for example). It also <I>only</I> 
works as intended with a moving coil meter and is not suited to driving digital 
panel meters or other electronic circuits. It <I>can</I> be done, but there's no 
point as the circuit would be far more complex than others shown here.</P>
<HR>
<B>Conclusion</B> 
<P>Although the waveforms and tests described above were simulated, the Figure 6 
circuit was built on my opamp test board. This board uses LM1458s - very slow 
and extremely ordinary opamps, but the circuit operated with very good linearity 
from below 20mV up to 2V RMS, and at all levels worked flawlessly up to 35kHz 
using 1k resistors throughout. 
<P>One thing that became very apparent is that the circuit is very intolerant of 
stray capacitance, including capacitive loading at the output. Construction is 
therefore fairly critical, although adding a small cap (as shown in Figure 5) 
will help to some extent. I don't know why this circuit has not overtaken the 
'standard' version in Figure 4, but that standard implementation still seems to 
be the default, despite its many limitations.  Chief among these are the number 
of parts and the requirement for a low impedance source, which typically means 
another opamp. The impedance limitation does not exist in the alternative 
version, and it is far simpler. 
<P>The Intersil and Burr-Brown alternatives are useful, but both have low (and 
non-linear) input impedance. They do have the advantage of using a single 
supply, making both more suitable for battery operated equipment or along with 
logic circuitry. Remember that all versions (Figures 7, 8 &amp; 9) <I>must</I> 
be driven from a low impedance source, and the Figure 7 circuit must also be 
followed by a buffer because it has a high output impedance. 
<P>In all, the Figure 6 circuit is the most useful. It is simple, has a very 
high (and linear) input impedance, low output impedance, and good linearity 
within the frequency limits of the opamps. The Figure 6A version is also useful, 
but has a lower input impedance and requires 2 additional resistors (R1 in 
Figure 6 is not needed if the signal is earth referenced). 
<P>The above circuits show just how many different circuits can be applied to 
perform (essentially) the same task. Each has advantages and limitations, and it 
is the responsibility of the designer to choose the topology that best suits the 
application. Not shown here, but just as real and important, is a software 
version. Digital signal processors (DSPs) are capable of rectification, 
conversion to RMS and almost anything else you may want to achieve, but are only 
applicable in a predominantly digital system.</P><A name="ref"></A>
